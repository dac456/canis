Canis is a game engine, as well as an associated toolchain of editors, written in C++. It is currently early in development, and uses OpenGL 3.3 for graphics. It supports a wide variety of model formats through the Assimp library, and can also natively load maps files created with 3D World Studio (.3dw), DeleD CE (.dxs), and Torque Constructor (.dif) (support for each of these file types is in varying stages of completion). The Bullet SDK is currently used for physics support.

The end goal is to create an engine capable of rendering and simulating a galaxy, with explorable planets.

All versions of the engine < 1.0.0 should be considered unstable, and any commit carries the possibility of breaking things and changing the API.
